                  Hi! <Emoji symbol="ðŸ‘‹" /> {` `}
                  I'm <strong>{author}</strong>. Welcome to my corner of the
                  internet.

                  I'm a Brooklyn-based software engineer interested in design
                  systems, component libraries, and the JAMStack. Before that, I
                  was an English major at Skidmore College in upstate New York.
                  Big transition, right?

                  You've stumbled on my personal site! I'm so happy that you're
                  here. You'll mostly find React coding tips, thoughts on design
                  systems, and the occasional personal post.

                  Sometimes, you might come to the site and the design will look
                  wonky, posts will be half-finished, or it'll just be totally
                  broken. I hope you don't mind <em>too</em> much! I spend a lot
                  of time writing sturdy code for Harry'sâ€“â€“I like to have a
                  place where I can fool around and try out new concepts without
                  worrying too much.
