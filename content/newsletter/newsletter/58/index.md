Happy Monday!

I hope you all had a great weekend! I know I did -- I love a crisp September morning!

Have you experimented with [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) yet? It's a relatively new library from Seek (they also have an open-source design system called [Braid](https://github.com/seek-oss/braid-design-system) that I'm a huge fan of).

At work, we've been using the library for about a month now, and I have to be honest, it's totally living up to the hype.

It dovetails nicely with the way I model [design tokens](/newsletter/52) conceptually in my mind, and its opinionated approach can lower the barrier to entry for early design systems teams.

## How does it solve common design tokens challenges?

### 1. Better performance

vanilla-extract styles are generated at build time instead of runtime. This allows design systems engineers to avoid the performance problems they might normally see if they used a JavaScript object to manage tokens.

### 2. Prevents breakage when tokens are edited or deleted

I've seen teams accidentally delete or rename a design token and cause breaking changes in consuming applications.

vanilla-extract provides type-safety via [CSSType](https://github.com/frenic/csstype). If someone accidentally deletes, renames, or misspells a token, it will trigger a TypeScript error describing exactly what went wrong.

### 3. Opinionated approach to theming

One of my favorite aspects of vanilla-extract is its opinionated approach to theming. Tokens and theming can be complicated to implement the first time around, and there are many potential approaches.

Early-stage design systems teams push forward more confidently by leveraging the experience of the design systems team over at Seek.
