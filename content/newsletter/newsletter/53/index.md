Yesterday, [@joeyabanks](https://twitter.com/joeyabanks) tweeted:

> Engineers are really incredible at being able to quickly spot all of the edge cases within a design that may have been overlooked.

Since design systems work requires a lot of collaboration between designers and developers, I came up with a set of cases that designers can think through before sharing their designs.

- All potential color variants
- All potential sized variants
- Accessible contrast for colors
- Accessible text sizes
- Responsive designs across all required breakpoints
- Focus states
- Hover states
- Active states
- Representations of each theme or mode (if applicable)
- What happens in different app states? (ex: is user logged in)
- What happens if something goes wrong?
- For how long should something be visible?
- What are the desired animations, if any?
- What are the max/min rules (and what happens beyond them)
- Icon and image assets

What do you think? Did I miss anything? Reply to this email and let me know!
