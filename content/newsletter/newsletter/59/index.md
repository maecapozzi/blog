Building accessible, useful, and ergonomic forms is a major challenge facing UX designers and frontend engineers.

The disabled button is a common symbol that we use to convey whether the data a user has submitted meets a form's constraints and requirements. When done well, enabling and disabling a button can provide useful feedback to a user. Unfortunately, it can also create confusion for users when not executed well.

This week, I read a fantastic post about this topic and I'd encourage you to read it as well: [Frustrating Design Patterns: Disabled Buttons](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/frustrating-design-patterns-disabled-buttons/). It's a long read, so take a moment, pour some coffee/matcha/tea/wine/bourbon/kombucha, and enjoy!

Talk soon,

Mae
