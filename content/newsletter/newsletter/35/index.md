Happy Friday!

Over the years I've read a lot of great essays about design systems, and want to share them with you.

This week's long-read is [Measuring the Health of a Design System](https://chasem.co/2020/08/design-system-health) by Chase McCloy. Chase defines what it means to have a healthy design system and shares examples of how his team tracks their system's health.
