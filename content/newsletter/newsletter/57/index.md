Happy Thursday!

Welcome to the _Jobs_ edition of the Design Systems Newsletter.

Before we get into this week's jobs, I have a small announcement!

I've been posting jobs for a little over a month, and there are now **over 30 jobs** available on the jobs board!

The newsletter and job board are also gaining traction across the internet. In fact, our subscriber count has grown by **118% since July 29!**

These changes are really exciting, and they mean that the job board is going to get **bigger and better!**

That means more high-quality Design Systems jobs, faster response times to get your opening filled sooner, and a stronger Design Systems community.

In order to support this growth, I've decided to introduce the following affordable pricing tiers for job postings on the Design Systems Job Board.

1. Post a job directly to the Design Systems Job Board for 30 days ($39)
2. Post a job to the Design Systems Job Board for 1 month + a shoutout in the newsletter on the first Thursday after posting ($89)
3. Post a **featured** (top of page) job to the Design Systems Job Board for 1 month + a shoutout in the newsletter for **every week** the job is live ($199)

However, I really appreciate all of your support, so **I'm giving you one last chance to post a job for free on the Design Systems Job Board!** Fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/tCRpGy7PMfQGqu5B9) before the end of the day on Sunday, and I will include you in next week's newsletter before transitioning to our new pricing tiers.

**Thank you for all your support so far,** and I am looking forward to this new chapter for the Design Systems Job Board!
