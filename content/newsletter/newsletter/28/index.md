Hey there!

Happy Tuesday. I hope you've been having a good week so far!
I was asking my new Twitter friend Chris Ferdinandi some advice about how to improve my newsletter, and he suggested that I write more frequently and more casually. He said he writes every single day!

I've decided I'd like to write shorter, more frequent newsletters for you all â€“â€“ and I'd love it if the topics came from you!

Do you have a question that you'd love an answer to? Reply to this email and I'll answer it publicly. That way, everyone in this community can learn together.
And if you think that I'm emailing you a bit too much, don't hesitate to let me know, and remember that you can always unsubscribe if you need to.

Warmly,
Mae
