It feels like there are an endless number of tools to help you style your design system in 2021:

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/)
- [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/)

It can feel impossible to get started when there are so many options to choose from.

Luckily for the rest of us, the Polaris team had an open discussion about the very topic, resulting in this awesome thread: [https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/44](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/44).

They also include a link to a more [detailed view](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rxrRTlbNWiLVu-Q5IK7xh5O1FmWcjyAS2XN7jiPrhYM/edit#gid=0) of the research if you'd like to dig in deeper.

Polaris chose [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), a new library from the engineers at [Seek](https://github.com/seek-oss). (By the way, if you haven't checked out Seek's design system [Braid](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/), you definitely should).

Some of the benefits of vanilla-extract include:

- TypeScript integration
- No runtime overhead
- An opinionated approach
- It's framework agnostic

I've found that the way vanilla-extract works is almost identical to the way that I tend to approach design tokens, so I'm really excited to continue to use the library.

Have you used vanilla-extract, or any of these other libraries? What did you think? Let me know by replying to this email.

Talk soon,
Mae
