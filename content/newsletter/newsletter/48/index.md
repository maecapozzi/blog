One of the first decisions you have to make when starting a design system's component library is whether you will allow style overrides.

This can be a controversial topic. I've had (passionate) discussions about this topic on 3 of the 4 design systems I've worked on.

At the time of this writing, 168 people have voted on this [Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1429426336695824384).

Like most design systems questions -- I think that it depends heavily on the business needs the design system is trying to solve.

| - You want to enforce design consistency across multiple codebases | - You need to support vastly different visual, multi-product experiences |
| - You want to raise design inconsistency to the DS maintainers     | - You are building foundational components anyone can use                |
