The other day I tweeted:

My favorite response came from my friend [Carl Vitullo](https://blog.vcarl.com/), who wrote:

He's totally right. If you're on a small team, and you're trying to ship your initial product or you're supporting a single, small application, you should not actively invest in building a design system. Design systems are only valuable at scale!

Design systems require a lot of upfront investment before they're valuable. And if you don't invest in them, they _will_ fail. Before you pitch the idea to your team, make sure that your use case fits the tool.

You might consider investing in a design system if your use case meets one or more of the following requirements:

1. You support three or more web applications
2. Your large monolithic application lacks design consistency
3. You have a large enough team, or can hire more people to focus solely on the design system effort
